            <h2> Welcome to the Beer Trip Agency! </h2>
            <p>
                Been a rough few weeks, correcting 100 ADA stories. How will you celebrate? A few drinks? A holiday maybe? 
                Why not both :-) Welcome to BTA (Beer Trip Agency SA), where we design beer-tasting trips around the world taking 
                into account our customers' preferences! Using the provided data, we design several trips around the world, 
                taking into account different parameters that might be relevant to our drunk-driven clients. We pick the best 
                spots corresponding to characteristics such as alcohol percentage, top-rated beers, and brewery diversity among 
                other things. Then, we establish a general ranking designed in relation to customer preferences, giving more or 
                less weight to the initial ratings. Once our algorithm brews through, we determine the regions that will make up 
                the world tour. We'll propose brewery visits in countries, along with the contacts of the region's best beer 
                lovers/experts. Ale the best for a trip Lager than life!

            <p>
                For this ranking, we considered the average percentage of alcohol in beers for every locations. This ranking 
                allows us to find the countries/locations with the strongest/softest beers. Whether you like 
                strong or soft beers this ranking will satisfy any tastes
